### StoryMaps

Below is my iframe for my story written in in the storymaps tutorial. I had a
lot of fun making this and make telling my story. The map aspect of it really
helps visualize where things are taking place. I can see how this tool would be
very helpful in many aspects of digital history and cant wait to use it more.

I have run into an issue here and my iframe doesnt seem to appear to be showing. I can't seem to figure out why it is not working.

### Maps from Spreadsheet

This tutorial was fairly simple and i did not run into any issues when doing
it. Although it was again something that if not telling a story, would be great
for visualization of where things are in the world when writing about
something.
