# Reflection

The readings for this part of the course have made me realize that although
there are many positives to digital history, they don't come without some
negatives as many things in life. Some of these positives are that we are able
to access so much more history easier. With most things being online, we have
access to anything with a quick search in google. On top of that, the
information we have access to is much greater than what was written in books,
hundreds of years ago. We have data to go along with the stuff that was written.
This allows us to paint a picture of peoples lives other than the ones written
in books which the only people that generally knew how to write were white men.
Although we don't have writings, we can see how other people lived and what
their lives were like off of the data we are able to create with digital
history. An example of this is Sarah Durrant brought up in the article "_Big_
_Data for Dead People: Digital Readings and the Conundrums of Positivism_". She
was a woman living during the 1870's in London. She wasn't anyone that changed
history or anything, but she was someone in which without digital history, we
would know nothing about. She was a poor woman that was sentenced to 2 years of
jail time because she stole bank notes. Whether she actually did it or not is
not something that the article really looked at, but the trial was looked at.
Since, trials are recorded in writing, we can read about what she stated in the
trial and are now able to somewhat get an idea of how many other people like her
would have lived at the time. Things like this would not have been possible to
study when our history strictly came from books and writings coming a a majority
of a certain demographic.

Now looking at the negatives we can see why some historians are criticizing the
some aspects of digital history. False information online can be found every day
and as you go online more, the more you encounter it. Sometimes this information
is spread due to people just wanting to mess with things. Most of the time it
is due to people believing that what they are writing is true. The article
"_Confabulation in the Humanities_" looks at this and just how much of a
negative effect it could have. In this article Matthew Lincoln writes about the
print work happening in the Netherlands. In the beginning of the article. He
has data and information stating that print work between 1550 and 1700 had
shifted from being a majority domestic to being majority international. There
is data and an explanation to support this. He then has data and an explanation
that completely counteracts what he had written before stating that it was
becoming more domestic. You later find out that the truth was actually that it
had become more domestic, but the other was completely believable. I actually
had to read it over again because I was confused as the explanations for the
data were so good that I believed both. It shows that digital history has
the ability to seem completely true even though it is not thanks to good
explanations to data.

I still believe that digital history is an amazing thing that has opened up
so much information to people that was not available before. As it continues to
grow we will find that some aspects of history are not as true as we thought
they originally were. Although, it is important to continue to check multiple
resources when looking at history as data is easy to make sound believable if
the person writing it believes in it. There is a difference between something
sounding reasonable and something actually being fact.
